# Group Policy â€“ Windows Server 2019 Security Hardening

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** within a simulated enterprise environment to enhance security, automate configuration, and enforce compliance on Windows Server systems. 

As part of Structureality Inc.'s internal security team, I implemented and validated organizational-level policies targeting a new Sales division. This lab aligns with **CompTIA Security+ objectives 4.5 and 4.7**, emphasizing enterprise security enhancement and automation.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Windows Server 2019**
- **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**
- **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**
- **Command Line Tools:** `gpresult`, `rsop`
- **Scripting:** `.cmd` batch files, `.txt` scripts
- **Virtual Environment:** DC10 (Domain Controller), PC10 (Client Machine)

---

## Objectives

- Establish a new Organizational Unit (OU)
- Apply and test Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Define account lockout policies and file system preferences
- Automate system behavior via logon/logoff scripts
- Validate policy propagation using administrative tools

---

## What I Did

### Organizational Unit Setup
- Created `SalesClients` OU in `ad.structureality.com`
- Migrated users (`Dani`, `Cam`) and a client machine (`PC10`) into the new OU

### GPO Creation and Linking
- Created `SalesPolicy` GPO linked to `SalesClients`
- Defined key settings under:
  - **Computer Configuration:** Account Lockout Policy (`3` invalid attempts)
  - **User Configuration:** Folder creation (`C:\SalesDocs`)

> - ![SalesDocsFolder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40a97dfd-cedb-4422-86ba-b2d5e9c66ae1)
### Script Automation
- Wrote basic `logon.txt` and `logoff.txt` messages
- Converted and deployed scripts as `.cmd` files via a network share
- Configured GPO to execute scripts at user logon/logoff

> - ![LogOnGP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b9f87db-db60-4494-8c27-c5faa47ba806)


### Policy Validation
- Used `gpresult /r` to verify policy enforcement
- Ran `rsop.msc` to confirm policy source and status
- Verified `SalesDocs` folder creation and script execution

## How to Reproduce

### Pre-requisites:
- Two Windows Server 2019 VMs: one domain controller (DC10), one client (PC10)
- Domain setup: `ad.structureality.com`

### Steps:
1. **Configure Active Directory:**
   - Create OU
   - Move users and computers
2. **Apply Group Policy:**
   - Create GPO (`SalesPolicy`)
   - Define policies (e.g., lockout thresholds, folders)
3. **Deploy Scripts:**
   - Share `C:\scripts` folder on DC10
   - Create `.cmd` scripts pointing to shared `.txt` files
   - Configure scripts in GPO
4. **Test & Validate:**
   - Log in as standard and admin users
   - Use `gpresult` and `rsop`
   - Observe logon/logoff behavior

## Key Learnings

- Reinforced how **GPOs enforce security compliance** without manual user intervention
- Practiced **centralized administration** of scripts and system configurations
- Understood the **importance of OU and GPO hierarchy** for scalable IT operations
- Gained hands-on experience using `gpresult` and `rsop` to debug and verify policies


## Future Improvements

- Implement **PowerShell-based logon/logoff scripts** for more dynamic automation
- Use **WMI filters** to target specific system types within the OU
- Integrate **security baselines** from Microsoft or CIS for production-like hardening
- Configure **software deployment policies** to push vetted apps to Sales division machines
