# Cybersecurity Vulnerability Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes cybersecurity vulnerabilities using datasets from the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**, **Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)**, and **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**. By leveraging data analytics and visualization techniques, the project identifies trends, risk factors, and exploitability patterns to enhance cybersecurity risk assessment.

## Features
- **Vulnerability Age Analysis**: Assesses the lifespan of vulnerabilities to prioritize mitigation.
- **CVSS Score Distribution**: Evaluates severity levels across vulnerabilities.
- **Exploitability vs. Severity**: Analyzes the correlation between known exploits and severity ratings.
- **Vendor and Product Risk Profiling**: Identifies high-risk vendors and products.
- **Time-Series Trend Analysis**: Tracks the evolution of cybersecurity threats over time.
- **CIA Impact Distribution**: Visualizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact ratings.

## Data Sources
- **[NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/)**: Provides a comprehensive repository of reported vulnerabilities.
- **[KEV Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)**: Lists vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild.
- **[CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/)**: Categorizes vulnerabilities by weakness type.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data wrangling and transformation.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data exploration.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.

## Data Processing
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Converted dates to proper `datetime` format.
   - Filtered missing or incomplete records.
   - Standardized CVSS severity classifications.
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Calculated vulnerability age.
   - Mapped severity levels from CVSS scores.
   - Created binary indicators for known exploits.
3. **Risk Classification**
   - Categorized vulnerabilities into **High Risk**, **Moderate Risk**, and **Low Risk** based on severity and exploitability.

## Key Visualizations
- **Histograms & Boxplots**: Show CVSS score distributions and vulnerability age trends.
- **Bar Charts**: Highlight top vulnerable products and common CWE categories.
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Illustrate the impact distribution on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Tracks the rise of critical vulnerabilities over the years.
- **Exploitability vs. Severity**: Demonstrates how vulnerabilities with known exploits tend to be more severe.
- **Vendor Risk Analysis**: Identifies vendors with the highest concentration of high-risk vulnerabilities.

## Results & Insights
- Most vulnerabilities fall into the **Medium to High severity range**.
- Exploitation often occurs **within the first 100 days** of disclosure.
- **Windows and Chromium V8** are among the most vulnerable products.
- CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) and CWE-787 (Out-of-Bounds Write) are the most common weakness categories.
- The number of **critical vulnerabilities has risen significantly since 2018**, emphasizing the need for proactive security measures.
